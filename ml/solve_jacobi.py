"""
Write a Python function that uses the Jacobi method to solve a system of linear equations given by Ax = b. The function should iterate n times, rounding each intermediate solution to four decimal places, and return the approximate solution x.

Example:
        input: A = [[5, -2, 3], [-3, 9, 1], [2, -1, -7]], b = [-1, 2, 3], n=2
        output: [0.146, 0.2032, -0.5175]
        reasoning: The Jacobi method iteratively solves each equation for x[i] using the formula x[i] = (1/a_ii) * (b[i] - sum(a_ij * x[j] for j != i)), where a_ii is the diagonal element of A and a_ij are the off-diagonal elements.
