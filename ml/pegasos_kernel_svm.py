"""Write a Python function that implements the Pegasos algorithm to
train a kernel SVM classifier from scratch.

The function should take a dataset (as a 2D NumPy array where each row
represents a data sample and each column represents a feature), a label
vector (1D NumPy array where each entry corresponds to the label of the
sample), and training parameters such as the choice of kernel (linear or
RBF), regularization parameter (lambda), and the number of iterations.
The function should perform binary classification and return the model's
alpha coefficients and bias.
